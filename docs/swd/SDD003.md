## ds2mermaid caller responsibilities

The ds2mermaid helper classes *do not* include any doorstop imports or
related functionality. Therefor it is the responsibility of the caller
software to discover the required (doorstop) data and  use it to create
the lists of document prefix strings, node UIDs, and links for each of
the discovered doorstop documents.

ds2mermaid itself has a doorstop document tree and an "example" user
script that demonstrates the following:

- building a doorstop document tree
- looping through lists of documents and document items
- loading diagram nodes and edges
