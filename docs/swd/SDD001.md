The ds2mermaid package provides a convenient interface and baseline
format for generating a mermaid diagram (source) from doorstop item
links. The primary build/test dependency is python-to-mermaid, while
doorstop is the primary runtime dependency for the required input
data. Package dependencies are shown in the figure below:
