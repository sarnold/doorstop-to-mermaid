# Design Elements

The ds2mermaid package provides a convenient interface and baseline
(graph) format for generating a mermaid diagram with subgraphs from
doorstop item links.

The primary build/test dependency is python-to-mermaid, while
doorstop is the primary runtime dependency for the required input
data. Package dependencies are shown in the figure below:

Doorstop-To-Mermaid Software Units (captured from mermaid to SVG or PNG).
