## ds2mermaid settings

The baseline doorstop diagram needs the following:

- the default mermaid diagram type is *Graph* and default direction is *TB*
- the subgraph inputs are based on the discovered doorstop document prefixes
- the graph node labels are item UIDs and the edges are item links

The software should provide both class and console interfaces to adjust the
above type and direction defaults, as well as accept a list of prefix strings.
