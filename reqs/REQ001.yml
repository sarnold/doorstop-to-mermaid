  Requirements overview for ds2mermaid

  The ds2mermaid package is intended to visualize the links between document
  items in a doorstop document tree. A tree contains one or more documents,
  where one document is the parent, and the rest are childern. Each document
  has one or more tracked items, with expected links from child items to
  their respective parent.

  The main dependencies are shown below.

  - [python-to-mermaid](https://pypi.org/project/python-to-mermaid/)
  - [doorstop](https://doorstop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

  The ds2mermaid package should support the following features/options.

  - support mermaid graph and subgraph types
  - set graph type
  - set graph direction
  - doorstop text selection options
    - item text
    - item uid
    - item short name
  - output a link diagram in mermaid source format

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The above item `short_name` is a custom doorstop attribute and
  > must be added to the doorstop config file, as well as populated
  > with the desired "alias" for the given item.
