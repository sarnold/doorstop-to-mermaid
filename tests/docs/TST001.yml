  Automated Tests

  Whether desktop or CI, run these tests from the project root,
  after installing Python and [Tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox):

  ```shell
  tox -e py
  ```

  To see test output, ie, code under test and print statements, append
  the following positional arg to the above tox command:

  ```shell
  tox -e py -- no
  ```
